			<p>Macropus rufus, or the red kangaroo, is the largest marsupial native to Australia. It has reddish-brown fur, powerful hind legs for hopping, and is well-adapted to arid environments. Red kangaroos feed on grasses, form social groups called mobs, and are active during cooler parts of the day. They play a crucial role in their ecosystem.</p>
